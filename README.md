# Project Title: Exploratory Analysis of Stack Overflow's Yearly Survey 2023

## Project Description:  
### Analyzing the Correlation between Demographics, Mental Health, and Workplace Culture in a Survey of Stack Overflow Members.Â¶ Stack Overflow, founded in 2008, is a website where people ask and answer programming questions to help each other out. It is widely used by programmers of all levels and backgrounds, but it is particularly popular among software developers who work with web development, mobile development, and data science. It publishes the data of the survey of its members yearly.

NOTE: Please see **'Report on Stack Overflow Data from 2023'**  file for latest review of findings.

## Installation: libraries or packages required:
- Python                           3+
- Jupyter_core                      5.2.0
- Matplotlib                        3.7.1
- Numpy                             1.24.1
- Pandas                            1.5.3
- Seaborn                           0.12.2

## Usage: 
The notebooks are mostly meant to be viewed as they are, I have not built in many adjustments for the reader. You can see the code used for each cell and its outcome to better understand where the data came from if you wish. I included as many notes as possible for those not familiar with Python, Pandas and Numpy. 

## File Organization: 
The bulk of this project is exploratory notebooks that contribute to a report. The **Report on Stack Overflow Data from 2023** is where you will find a summary of the insights found and descriptions of where to locate methods used for each section. Other notebooks that are of importance are:

- **Stack Overflow Data Analysis, WHOLE,age,gender, mental health, devop**

- **General Demographics by Country**

- **Salary**
